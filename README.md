# Package-Delivery-System
## Scenario 
<p>
  
The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for their daily local deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver daily. Each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements listed in the attached “WGUPS Package File.”

 

Your task is to determine an algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages will be delivered on time while meeting each package’s requirements and keeping the combined total distance traveled under 140 miles for all trucks. The specific delivery locations are shown on the attached “Salt Lake City Downtown Map,” and distances to each area are given in the attached “WGUPS Distance Table.” The intent is to use the program for this specific location and many other cities where WGU has a presence in each state. As such, you must include detailed comments to make your code easy to follow and justify the decisions you made while writing your scripts.
